WHERE - Filters what data has to be retrieved based on conditions given.

ORDER BY - Used to sort data based on column(s) either in ascending or descending order. 
Default is ascending if sort order not mentioned.
Note: Column order is important as sorting is sequential.

GROUP BY - Is used to aggregate and group data. Combines rows (aggregates) with same value. 
Aggregates a column by another column.
Note: All columns included in the select must be either aggregated or included in the group by.
Note: The result of group by is determined by the unique values of grouped columns.

AS(Alias) - Shorthand name(label) assigned to a column or table in a query.

COUNT - Aggregate function to get the total number of values.

SUM - Aggregate function is used to add up values.

HAVING - This clause is used to filter on aggregated data.
Note: WHERE clause is used to filter data before aggregation.
HAVING clause is used to filter data after aggregation.

DISTINCT - Removes duplicate values and returns unique values from a column.

TOP - Is used to limit the number of rows returned (does bsed on row numbers).

Code Ordering - SELECT : DISTINCT : TOP : COLUMNS : FROM : TABLE : WHERE : GROUP BY : HAVING : ORDER BY
Execution Ordering - FROM : TABLE : COLUMNS : WHERE : GROUP BY : HAVING : SELECT : DISTINCT : TOP : ORDER BY

/ - To escape special characters. You can escape ' with another ' quote
