Relational:
How columns(attributes) relate to each other to define a thing(object,row).
Note: Relational does not actually mean multiple tables. It is putting related dated in one table.

Things to consider when creating a table:
1. What is the main thing you want your table to be about?
2. How will you use this table (list of information)?
3. How can you most easily query the table (information breakdown)?

Atomic data:
Smallest pieces of data that can't or shouldn't be divided further.

Questions to ask to put atomic data in your table:
1. What is the one thing that your table describes?
2. How will you use the table to get at the one thing?
3. Do your columns contain atomic data to make your queries short an to the point?

Rules for atomic data:
1. A column with atomic data can't have several values of the same type of data.
2. A table with atomic data can't have several columns with the same type of data.

Normalization:
Is to organize data inorder to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

1NF:
- Each row of data must contain atomic values.
- Each row must have an unique identifier known as a Primary Key.
